# Modeling Energy Usage Patterns
Modeling energy usage from submeters

Hi,

I have exciting news. Weâ€™re about to close a deal with a regional home developer to develop analytics for a new set of electrical sub-metering devices used for power management in Smart Homes. Installing these sub-meters could be a big step towards the developer's goal of offering highly efficient Smart Homes that providing owners with power usage analytics.

As a starting point, they have provided us with a very large data set that contains 47 months of energy usage data from these devices. Our job over the next few weeks will be to analyze this data to determine what kind of analytics and visualizations can be created that would empower Smart Home owners with greater understanding and control of their power usage.


It is important to remember that we do not know what the data will show, and neither does the home builder; it is your job to tell them how we will conduct the analysis and what they are likely to gain, so be precise and accurate with your findings and any initial recommendations. However, keep in mind that you will be presenting your report to business rather than technical people.

Afterwards, I'd like you to begin build predictive models that will demonstrate to our client how the data can be used to help a home owner to make decisions about altering power consumption. 

Well, the future of this project is in your capable hands! Gather the required resources and prove that the sub-metering devices will deliver the value the developer seeks through data analytics.

Good luck,

Kathy

VP, IOT Analytics
